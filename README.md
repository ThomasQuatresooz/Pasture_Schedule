## Presentation

So for my pasture time, i want to do my website / portfolio / Blog with Gatsby & Strapi.

With this, i can learn in a deeper way the world of CMS, React and have a touch with GraphQL.

About CMS, i need to check Nico's wordpress project because, well..., it's Wordpress.

I wish to have a glimpse of AWS / Google Cloud / Azure. I guess it can be useful.

Well, i think i also need to check a way to do a Mobile App, so why not Flutter and trying Dart
